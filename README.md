# Machine Learning Estimation of the Future Climate Risk Amplification of Food Security-Induced Conflict

Climate change (e.g. global warming) and climate variability (e.g. La Nina and El Nino) amplify the risk of potential conflict between parties with existing tensions. For example, the Arab Spring uprising in 2010/2011 was triggered when existing political tensions within Egypt were heightened due to excessive bread prices, brought on by climate-induced wheat production reductions in exporting nations (e.g. Australia, China, Russia). We aim to understand, visualize and model the chain of influence from the: climate; to agricultural production; commodity prices; trade; and finally, the risk of potential conflict. A better understanding of the interactions between the physical climate and these human social systems is key to better assessing and proactively dealing with the associated climate impacts. This is particularly pertinent in a future world with increasing population and resource scarcity.

## Expected outcomes

There are several sub-components to addressing the above task. We would work with the interests of the students to ensure they are working on the sub-component most compatible with their interests and abilities:

1. Population: An understanding and visualization of existing population demographic projections per nation from now until the end of the century, and the curation of measures of historical social unrest and conflict.

2. Production: Assessment of the appropriate machine learning hyper-parameter settings in determining the relationships between a suit of climate variables and the agricultural production of commodities key to food security (e.g. wheat, rice, maize, soy).

3. Price: Assessment of the appropriate machine learning hyper-parameter settings in determining the relationships between agricultural yield and price for the above commodities, or alternatively between the climate variables and price directly.

4. Trade: Visualisation of the trade of these agricultural commodities between producing and consuming nations (including local consumption), and characterization of the stability of this trade network in time.

5. Climate: Comparison of climate model simulations to historical observations per scale (i.e. sized vortex), and hence determining which of these scales are trustworthy in future climate projections out to the end of the century.
